netCDF4p
========

Wrapper around python-netCDF4 that allows Coordinate subscripting, similar to NCL.

It has the full capability of python-netCDF4 *plus* allows coordinate subsetting. This is how you use it::

    import netCDF4p as ncp
    # open netCDF file
    ncf = nc.Dataset('file.nc')
    # given the variable Temperature has the dimensions | time x lat x lon |
    # you can select a region that conforms to 0째 to 30째N and 0째 to 20째 E like so:
    ncf.variables['Temperature'][:, {0, 30}, {0, 20}]
    # coordinate selections can also be made passing a dict ('named argument')
    ncf.variables['Temperature'][:, {'lat' : (0, 30), 'lon' : (0, 20)}]
